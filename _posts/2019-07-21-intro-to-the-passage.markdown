I'd like to start this development blog off with a short intro to the game. The Passage is a VR horror game developed in Unity using SteamVR. The game can be played in both room-scale and standing (room-scale is recommended) and is targeting a PC VR audience.

*At the height of American western expansion, pioneers and explorers sought to establish a link between the Pacific states and the rest of America. Those brave enough to venture to the burgeoning west had to contend with sickness, famine, and extreme weather. However, in this isolated wilderness, other dangers have put a chilling stop to expansion.*

*Atop the frigid, snow-capped mountains lies the Passage. According to the local frontiersmen, unpredictable and strange weather patterns prevent traversal and have led to the disappearance of numbers of pioneer parties. But the local tribes speak of intelligent, man-eating creatures that stalk the landscape once the sun sets over the Passage. As a result, those with a desire to live do not travel at night.*


#### The game will feature:
- Beautiful, open terrain set in the mountainous American west
- A story that takes the player deep into The Passage seeking answers and piecing together the events leading to the disappearances of railroad construction workers
- Intelligent monsters based on Native American folklore
- Day/night cycle with a dynamic weather system featuring snow and windstorms
- 19th century weaponry
